"""
Turn the text GitHub gives back after uploading the staged clips into
data/attachments.json, so build.py can emit real inline players.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/ingest_uploads.py pasted.txt [--index DIR/index.json]

Mapping is by filename when GitHub includes it (`[003_minchoi.mp4](url)`), and
by upload order otherwise. Order-only input must cover the files in the same
order they were staged; the script says which numbers it filled either way, so
a wrong batch is obvious before anything is committed. Re-runs merge, so you
can upload in batches and ingest each one as you go.
